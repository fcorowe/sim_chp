Overall aim: To set our view about how the field of spatial interaction modelling should evolve.

Key argument: Spatial interaction models are great, yet, not progress has been made over the last two/three decades (though we should recognise the work LeSage on spatial econometrics, Dan Griffith on spatial filtering, Kanaroglou et al on spatial discrete choice modelling, radiation models). Key challenges have prevented progress:

1\. reproducibility

2\. calibration <!--# AD - to elaborate this idea of calibration. I have long struggled with the term calibration in the context of spatial interaction modelling. In the olden days,  people used calibration to describe curve fitting parameters in a mathemathical framework. In a statistical context, I would understand this as the steps taken for a model to converge. -->

3\. large volumes of granular spatial data <!--# FR - my argument here is that up to recently we did not have the need to deal with large data sets capturing movement. I argue that this imposes two additional challenges: (1) need to capture heterogeneity/variability across different populations and places, and (2) need for new and scalable models (where machine learning and other modelling frameworks come in) -->.

Context: spatial interaction modelling in a world of big data, machine learning, open science, digital technology and uncertainty.

The text included here is for our own benefit. The idea of challenges

# Definition and Uses

Objective of the section: To conceptually describe what spatial interaction modelling is (including its key components), how it is used, why it is important and how it relates to gravity modelling. I conceive this section to provide a brief, gentle, intuitive introduction to spatial interaction models, emphasising its importance and the various context of applications of SIMs i.e. retail, population, transport, etc.

-   Mention of key SIM paradigms

<!--# FR: I would say let's introduce the intuition of traditional gravity models and then what progress has been made. -->

SIMs cover a wide range of methods and applications. According to @rodrigue_geography_2013, there are 3 broad types of SIM:

-   Gravity models, in which interaction is estimated as a function of size/attractiveness of start/end points and some impedance function; this is the original and 'traditional' SIM.

-   Radiation models or 'potential models', in which interaction is estimated as a function of size/attractiveness of start/end points but mediated by a function of intervening opportunities [@simini_universal_2012].

-   Retail models, which seek to identify the 'market boundary' between economic hubs.

For the majority of this paper we will focus on gravity models. There are four main types of traditional SIMs [@wilson_family_1971] :

-   Unconstrained

-   Production-constrained

-   Attraction-constrained

-   Doubly-constrained

The basic unconstrained SIM can be defined was follows, in a paper that explored many iterations on this formulation:

$$
T_{i j}=K \frac{W_{i}^{(1)} W_{j}^{(2)}}{c_{i j}^{n}}
$$ "where $T_{i j}$ is a measure of the interaction between zones $i$ and $W_{i}^{(1)}$ is a measure of the 'mass term' associated with zone $z_i$, $W_{j}^{(2)}$ is a measure of the 'mass term' associated with zone $z_j$, and $c_{ij}$ is a measure of the distance, or generalised cost of travel, between zone $i$ and zone $j$". $K$ is a 'constant of proportionality' and $n$ is a parameter to be estimated.

Redefining the $W$ terms as $m$ and $n$ for origins and destinations respectively [@simini_universal_2012], this classic definition of the 'gravity model' can be written as follows:

$$
T_{i j}=K \frac{m_{i} n_{j}}{c_{i j}^{n}}
$$

Identify reproducibility, calibration and big data as key challenges as noted above. If we frame these as key challenges, I think it would make sense to map the rest of the sections onto these challenges. The issue I have on doing this is that the issues of calibration and big data may entail similar or the same challenges.

# Expanding spatial interaction modelling

Objective of the section: To discuss ways in which spatial interaction modelling can be expanded. I am particularly interested in advocating for (1) seeing spatial interaction models in a context of uncertainty, rather than as mathematical models; and, (2) discussing how hierarchical / generalised linear mixed modelling can offer ways to capture variability across places and populations.

# Reproducible SIMs <!--# update section title? -->

Objective of the section: To discuss the opportunities and challenges of estimating spatial interacting modelling in the context of reproducible research

# Spatial interaction modelling using machine learning

Objective of the section: To discuss how machine learning can enhance flow count inference and prediction

# Facilitating future progress of spatial interaction modelling

Objective of the section: To identify and discuss the key pillars that will enable progress on all the proposed fronts - open science, important and new questions and digital infrastructure. I see this as our conclusion - probably one or two short paragraph summarising what has been discussed with a forward looking approach.
